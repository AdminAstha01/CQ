The Vision

“To explore infinite possibilities of FUN”
Through ages, human being is wired to always find a way to explore FUN and that raw motivation is why a GAME is created. In the beginning, there was only a simple traditional game but then we, human being keeps coming up with a new way to create a new form of FUN. Now 2 millennia later, we already arrived at the age of Video games.

From a simple pixel that represents a tennis ball to a humble mustachio plumber who must jump around to save a damsel in distress and finally came along the advent of a new massive social interactive game genre that was later known as the MMORPG.
And here we are, as a firm believer in MMORPG media, we fully believe that such genre is an endless frontier to explore FUN. Not only as a social platform where player can enjoy their memorable adventure together, but as a media to explore a brand-new world that is always exciting and FUN. 

Now…allow us to take you to our world, a new MMORPG world that inspired from Southeast Asian region with some cyberpunk & sci-fi twist, a universe that we called the “Chain Quadrant”.

A different kind of MMORPG.

Most MMORPGs that are available in the market right now are usually using medieval fantasy theme or a generic sci-fi as their go-to setting. 
However, in the world of Chain Quadrant, the game is taking its inspiration from different sources. From old classic anime such as “Cowboy Bebop” where the bounty hunter story narrative is accompanied with awesome Jazz soundtrack and a classic MMORPG gameplay approach from the 2000’s era like Ragnarok Online, SEAL Online and Runescape. 

It's no longer a secret that SEA gamers community are one of the most passionate gamers around and the promising SEA market has been known to draw many well-known game studios to target SEA gamers in the past couple of years now. And for that reason, the game will also be crafted with Southeast Asian (SEA) gamer demographic in mind. With the universe of Chain Quadrant, we also hope that the SEA player can embrace their Southeast Asian heritage from a new perspective and find their beloved cities with some Cyberpunk twist.

Both Free2Play and Passionate Investing players are both strong in SEA market and therefore the universe of Chain Quadrant is created to cater them in a world setting that they are already familiar with, but at the same time feels so fresh and new.

Overview:
-	Free2Play MMORPG with Southeast Asian gamers demographic in mind.
-	Narrative driven Quests with some comedic storyline approach.
-	No Pay-to-Win philosophy, all players must fight their way up all the same.
-	Depicting many Southeast Asian cities with cyberpunk and sci-fi twist.
-	Stylize Japanese Anime bounty hunter characters.
-	Special Rare Weapons & Cosmetics when connecting to Crypto Wallet.
-	Crypto Wallets are optional, Off Chain play plausible.
-	ChatGPT AI driven NPC characters that will blend naturally with the world.

CQ’s CORE PILLARS
-	Web “Agnostic” Game, can be played in both OFF-CHAIN and ON-CHAIN.
-	Web3 is optional, but encouraged.
-	NFT Interoperability, can be used at other Astha’s game title.

Until recently, the Web3 Gaming trends still having its up and down and our team acknowledge that the adaptation and adjustment for ordinary Web2 / Traditional gamers to be able to jump into the Web3 gaming scene still have its many shares of challenges. 

With that in mind, we are aiming to create Chain Quadrant (CQ) to become easy to access even for traditional gamers and we hope that with some extra Web3 game elements will encourage them to try the Web3 part of the game. 

Some Web3 elements that will be incorporated into CQs are:
o	NFTs (helmets, “land” spaceship, “pet” drones, weapons, armors)
o	NFTs will allow special access (exclusive dungeons, exclusive emotes)
o	CQ’s NFT is interoperability to other Astha Studios’ titles.

The transition is hoped to be smooth and voluntarily as we don’t want to force players who are still sceptical and not really into Web3 Gaming, especially the SEA players who are not that familiar with the Web3 & Blockchain industry in general.

GAME CORELOOP
1.	Get the Narrative Quest for your target from “Faction” party. 
2.	Hunt Criminal Target to get your reward and in-game money, “DIPS”
3.	While hunting, you will gain some materials for your weapon upgrade.
4.	Exchange your DIPS & Materials to upgrade your equipment.
5.	Level Up, Upgrade Skills and ready for more challenging Quests
6.	Back to number 1.

OFF-CHAIN & ON-CHAIN MMORPG

Chain Quadrant (CQ) will be able to be played in both OFF-CHAIN and ON-CHAIN, meaning that the player chooses to play the game without NFT or connecting into their crypto wallet, it still possible for them to play CQ nevertheless.

Without the web3 elements, the player will be playing in OFF-CHAIN mode. These OFF-CHAIN players will still be able to enjoy the game’s many features, however, they can only access normal type of equipment, pets, cosmetics, and some exclusive dungeons might not be accessible to them. 

In other hand, ON-CHAIN player that purchased special NFT collectibles and connecting their crypto wallet might have a special access to different type of special premium equipment, premium pets, cosmetics with its unique traits.
The unique traits are mainly cosmetics and has its special lore within the CQ Universe and has a slightly better stats compared to their normal counterpart.

The differences between OFF-CHAIN & ON-CHAIN players:

OFF-CHAIN mode	ON-CHAIN mode
In-Game Dips (name of the in-game currency)	($TOKENNAME)
Normal Weapons	Premium Cosmetic Weapon & Armor with lore
Normal Armor Set	Premium Drone “Pets” with lore
Normal Pets, “Drone”	Premium Emotes
Normal Emotes	Spaceship “Land” NFT
